GamePlay: The Mod will be a full, standalone RPG Mod. Fully taking over Minecrafts core Gameplay. Overworld, Nether, End will be not accessible. When loading into the Map, you will spawn in a "Lobby" Intruducing Player to the World of MCSAO. In the Lobby, they can enter any additional information to prep them before they spawn into the Town of Beginning. The Server we will be hosting will be the Official MCSAO Server. 

Progress of the Official MCSAO Server will be hosted in a Database of our own to track Items, information and such about Character(Player). Server Owners may request a "License" to become a Licensed MCSAO Server Host which allows their Server to communicate with our Database to allow Character Transfer from one server to another. Unlicensed Servers cannot connect. 

Mod Distribution:

When we begin distribution of MCSAO Mod, We will be bundling the Mod with an Installer, the Installer will contain the Mod itself, the Map we will be officially hosting, and any other resource packs and such. Since the Maps will be "Near" Identical out of the box, Server Owners may make modifications to the map as they please. To be a Licensed MCSAO Server, there will be guidelines to what they can and can't add to avoid making the experience of leveling up "Easier" on other servers, etc. 

Updates:

When the Map first officially released, anywhere from 5-10 Floors will be available. As the Game progress and players get higher levels, There will be Caps for all progressive Levels. Such as Player Level, Ability Level, Stat Level, Item Level, ETC. Updates will be announced through our community Outlet we choose at that time, ALL MCSAO Server will be connected to our Database to receive global Broadcast for news about the Mod. This option can be disabled within the Mods configs. And this will also annouce to the servers at the same time as we announce it.
